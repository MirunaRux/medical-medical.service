 * Spring @Configuration annotation is part of the spring core framework.
 * Classes annotated with @Configuration is a new way of configuring Spring using annotations instead of XML files.
 *
 * Spring @Configuration annotation allows you to use annotations for dependency injection, like @Bean definition methods.
 * So Spring container can process the class and generate Spring Beans to be used in the application.
